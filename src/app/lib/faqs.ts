// //frequently asked questions leading to FAQs page.

// 1. What is FOOM?
// FOOM turns your screen time into savings and investments. Instead of wasting hours scrolling, FOOM converts your time into financial growth. Every minute you spend online can now help build wealth.
// 2. How does FOOM actually work?
// Before you open a social or gaming app, FOOM asks how many minutes you want to spend. When your time runs out, you can either stop or buy more minutes with FOOM tokens. The token purchases automatically go into your savings or investment account.
// 3. Why should I pay to use my own screen time?
// You’re not really paying — you’re saving. Every time you “buy more minutes,” your money is invested in your own account (like a money market fund or savings wallet). FOOM simply turns your distraction into disciplined financial growth.
// 4. Who is FOOM for?
// FOOM is designed for Gen Z, Millennials, students, and young professionals who want to save without budgeting stress. If you spend a lot of time on social media or gaming, FOOM is perfect for you. It helps you stay in control of your time and money effortlessly.
// 5. What makes FOOM different from other apps?
// Screen time apps only show your usage, and blockers restrict you with no rewards. FOOM is the only app that links screen time to real savings and investments. It doesn’t punish you — it rewards you for making better choices.
// 6. What do I get out of using FOOM?
// You build financial discipline without even trying. Instead of guilt or wasted time, you get savings, investments, and progress toward personal goals. FOOM makes every scroll meaningful.
// 7. Can FOOM really help me save money?
// Yes — the more time you spend online, the more you save. Imagine saving Ksh 1,000 a month just from your scrolling habits. With FOOM, discipline is automatic and effortless.
// 8. Do I need to stop using social media or games?
// Not at all — FOOM doesn’t ask you to quit. It simply nudges you to be more intentional with your time. You can still enjoy your apps, but now every minute helps your savings grow.
// 9. How do I track my progress?
// FOOM has a built-in dashboard that shows your saved money, screen time, and goals. You’ll see weekly reports that highlight your progress. It’s like a financial mirror of your habits.
// 10. Where does my money go?
// Your money goes directly into linked accounts like money market funds, savings, or investments. FOOM doesn’t hold your money — it routes it safely to your chosen accounts. That way, every purchase of minutes grows your financial future.
// 11. Is FOOM safe to use?
// Yes — FOOM uses secure integrations with trusted financial institutions. Your money never disappears; it only grows in your own account. Privacy and security are built into the platform.
// 12. How much does FOOM cost?
// Downloading FOOM is free. You only “pay” when you buy more minutes, but that money goes directly into your own savings or investments. In other words, using FOOM costs nothing — it builds your wealth.
// 13. What if I don’t want to buy more minutes?
// That’s perfectly fine — you can simply exit the app when your time is up. FOOM encourages balance, not pressure. You’ll still see your time usage and savings progress.
// 14. How does FOOM keep me motivated?
// FOOM gamifies self-control — you earn tokens, hit milestones, and watch your savings grow. Small nudges remind you of the real value of your time. The more you use FOOM, the more rewarding it becomes.
// 15. Why should I start now?
// The sooner you begin, the faster you’ll turn wasted minutes into money. Every day of scrolling could mean missed savings. Starting today puts you in control of both your time and your future.
